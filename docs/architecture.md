# BloomTrack System Architecture

## Overview

The BloomTrack system is designed as a modular, scalable architecture for detecting and predicting plant blooming events globally using satellite and Earth observation data. This document outlines the system components, data flow, and key design decisions.

## System Components

### 1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing Layer

**Components:**
- **Data Acquisition Service**: Interfaces with satellite data providers and Earth observation APIs
- **Data Format Converter**: Handles various input formats (HDF5, NetCDF, GeoTIFF, shapefiles)
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Performs reprojection, clipping, alignment, and quality control
- **Feature Extraction Engine**: Computes vegetation indices and extracts environmental features

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Acquire raw satellite imagery and Earth observation data
- Convert and normalize data formats
- Apply atmospheric corrections and cloud masking
- Calculate vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, etc.)
- Extract environmental features (elevation, soil type, climate variables)
- Generate training datasets for machine learning models

### 2. Storage Layer

**Components:**
- **Spatial Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for vector data and spatial queries
- **Raster Store**: Optimized storage for large raster datasets with efficient access patterns
- **Time Series Database**: For storing temporal data and facilitating time-based queries
- **Object Storage**: For raw data files, processed outputs, and model artifacts
- **Metadata Catalog**: Tracks data lineage, processing history, and dataset relationships

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Efficiently store and retrieve spatial and temporal data
- Support spatial indexing and geospatial queries
- Manage data versioning and lineage tracking
- Optimize storage for different access patterns (analytical vs. serving)

### 3. Modeling & Prediction Layer

**Components:**
- **Model Training Pipeline**: Trains and validates machine learning models
- **Feature Engineering Service**: Prepares features for model training and inference
- **Model Registry**: Stores and versions trained models
- **Batch Prediction Service**: Runs large-scale predictions for entire regions
- **Real-time Inference Service**: Handles on-demand prediction requests

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Train models to detect and predict bloom events
- Handle both spatial and temporal aspects of prediction
- Support multiple model types (traditional ML, deep learning)
- Manage model versioning and deployment
- Optimize prediction performance and accuracy

### 4. API & Backend Services

**Components:**
- **REST API Gateway**: Provides unified access to system capabilities
- **Authentication & Authorization Service**: Manages user access and permissions
- **Tile Server**: Generates and serves map tiles for visualization
- **Asynchronous Task Queue**: Handles long-running operations
- **Caching Layer**: Improves performance for frequently accessed data

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Expose prediction and data access endpoints
- Generate and serve map tiles for web visualization
- Process user queries and requests
- Manage authentication and authorization
- Handle asynchronous and batch processing tasks

### 5. Web Frontend

**Components:**
- **Map Visualization**: Interactive maps with bloom overlays
- **Time Control**: Slider and animation controls for temporal exploration
- **Data Dashboard**: Charts, graphs, and statistics
- **Query Interface**: Tools for location-based and temporal queries
- **User Management**: Account settings and preferences

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Provide intuitive user interface for data exploration
- Visualize bloom predictions and historical data
- Support interactive queries and filtering
- Present analytical insights and trends
- Ensure responsive performance across devices

## Data Flow

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**:
   - Raw satellite data → Data Acquisition Service → Format Converter → Preprocessing Pipeline
   - Preprocessed data → Feature Extraction → Feature Store

2. **Model Training**:
   - Feature Store → Feature Engineering → Model Training Pipeline → Model Registry

3. **Prediction Generation**:
   - New satellite data → Preprocessing → Feature Extraction
   - Features + Trained Models → Prediction Service → Prediction Store

4. **Data Serving**:
   - Prediction Store → Tile Generation → Tile Server → Web Frontend
   - User Query → API Gateway → Inference Service → Response

## Scalability & Performance Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Containerized microservices deployable on Kubernetes
- Stateless API services that can scale independently
- Distributed processing for batch operations

### Data Partitioning
- Geospatial partitioning by region/grid
- Temporal partitioning by time periods
- Multi-level tile pyramids for different zoom levels

### Caching Strategy
- Tile caching for frequently accessed map areas
- Query result caching for common requests
- CDN integration for static assets and tiles

### Asynchronous Processing
- Queue-based architecture for heavy processing tasks
- Background workers for batch predictions
- Webhook notifications for long-running operations

## Security Considerations

- API authentication using JWT tokens
- Role-based access control for different user types
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Audit logging for system operations

## Monitoring & Observability

- Distributed tracing across services
- Performance metrics collection
- Centralized logging
- Alerting for system anomalies
- Health checks and service status dashboard

## Deployment Architecture

- Docker containers for all services
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Blue/green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates
- Environment separation (development, staging, production)

## Future Extensibility

- Plugin architecture for new data sources
- Model adapter interface for new ML techniques
- API versioning strategy
- Feature flag system for gradual rollout
- Event-driven architecture for system integration

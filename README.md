# BloomTrack: Global Plant Bloom Detection & Prediction System

## Project Overview

BloomTrack is a comprehensive system for detecting and predicting plant blooming events globally using satellite and Earth observation data. The platform provides interactive maps, APIs, and analytics tools for monitoring and forecasting plant bloom patterns across different regions and species.

## System Architecture

The BloomTrack system follows a modular, microservices-based architecture with the following key components:

### 1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing Layer
- Handles acquisition and processing of satellite imagery and Earth observation data
- Supports multiple data formats (HDF5, NetCDF, GeoTIFF, shapefiles, vector data)
- Performs reprojection, clipping, alignment, and computation of vegetation indices
- Extracts features for modeling (spectral indices, environmental variables)

### 2. Storage Layer
- Spatial database (PostgreSQL + PostGIS) for vector data and metadata
- Object storage for raster data and processed tiles
- Time-series database for temporal analysis and forecasting

### 3. Modeling & Prediction Layer
- Machine learning pipeline for bloom detection and prediction
- Supports both traditional ML and deep learning approaches
- Handles temporal modeling (seasonality, trends) and spatial correlation
- Provides both batch processing and on-demand prediction capabilities

### 4. API & Backend Services
- REST API endpoints for querying predictions and data
- Tile server for serving map layers
- Authentication and user management
- Asynchronous task processing for heavy computations

### 5. Web Frontend
- Interactive map interface with time slider
- Data visualization components (charts, graphs)
- User dashboard for customized views and analytics
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile access

## Key Features
